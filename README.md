## Project Goals
- Build a modern, single-page portfolio site from scratch
- Learn HTML/CSS fundamentals and try out JavaScript
- Utilize version control with Git/GitHub
- Document every lesson, “aha!” moment, and pitfall along the way because that's how I learn
---

## What’s Here
- `index.html` — Main site page
- `style.css` — All site styles, with comments
- `assets/` — Images, resume, and extras
---

## Coding Style & Rules
- **Font:** Only Raleway and system sans-serif (never Arial because Arial font is gross. hashtag comic sans before Arial)
- **Color palette:** Earthy/outdoors, defined in `:root` for easy tweaking
- **All styles and sections commented** because good comments help the learnin'
- **No `.bak` files**—Git handles versioning
- **Mobile/responsive tweaks** grouped at the bottom of the CSS
---

## Future Plans
- Add more sections (Projects, Contact, etc.)
- Experiment with JavaScript for interactivity
- Keep growing the README and comment evarythang
